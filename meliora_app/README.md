# Meliora 

An app for providing mental health resources and habit tracking features for its users

## About

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of mental health illness was increasing. With the pandemic in play, the statistics of mental health illness in the United States saw a new all time high. Problems posed by the pandemic as well as new government regulations put a strain on people's mental health. Meliora is a self-care app for mental wellness designed with the hope to help Americans and the world at large cope with mental health challenges. This project was a huge learning curve for us as we got to work with various tools and resources that we had little to no experience with. We brainstormed and came up with ideas of what we wanted the app to look like, features to be included and how we were going to achieve our goals. The wireframe/ design for the app was done using Figma and then was built using Flutter. We had issues with time constraint, as we were not able to fully develop our app. It was also a bit of a struggle as we had to maneuver our way through these new resources
